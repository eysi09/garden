# Garden Dashboard _(experimental)_

This directory contains an experimental web dashboard for the Garden CLI.

## Usage

To use with the Garden CLI, simply run:

```sh
garden serve
```

and follow the dashboard link printed by the command.

## Develop

To develop the dashboard, first run:

```sh
garden serve
```

to start the `garden-service` API server, then run:

```sh
npm start
```

to start the dashboard development server. The `start` command returns a link to the development version of the dashboard. The default is `http://localhost:3000`.

### CORS

To avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors while developing, we proxy the request to the `garden-service` server, defaulting to port `9777`. If the `garden-service` server is running on a different port, use:

```sh
REACT_APP_GARDEN_SERVICE_PORT=PORT npm start
```

See also `src/setupProxy.js` and [Adding Custom Environment Variables](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

## Build

To build the dashboard, run:

```
npm build
```

This builds the dashboard into the `build` directory, from where the `garden-service` API server serves it.

## About

### Tech

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with TypeScript support. It also uses:

* [emotion v10](https://emotion.sh/) for inline styling,
* [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) for the grid system, and
* [React Router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing.

### Structure

The app is structured into presentational components (`src/components`), container components (`src/container`), and provider/consumer components (`src/context`).

**Presentational components:** These are re-usable UI components. They receive outside data as props and have minimal state.

**Container components:** These load data and pass to the presentational components. A container might call the API directly or obtain the data from a consumer component (or both).

**Provider/consumer components:** These are re-usable components that contain "global" data that needs to be accessible by many (presentational) components in the tree. The provider/consumer pattern is a part of the new [React context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

Maintaining this separation will make it easier to migrate to different state management patterns/tools as the app evolves.
