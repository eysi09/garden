# Template strings

## Introduction

String configuration values in `garden.yml` can be templated to inject, among other things, variables,
information about the user's environment, references to other modules/services etc.

The syntax for templated strings is `${some.key}`. The key is looked up from the context available when
resolving the string. The context depends on which top-level key the configuration value belongs to (`project`
or `module`). See below for the full context that is available for each of those.

For example, for one service you might want to reference something from another module and expose it as an
environment variable:

```yaml
module:
  name: some-module
  services:
    - name: some-service
      # ...
      env:
        OTHER_MODULE_VERSION: ${modules.other-module.version}
```

You can also inject a template variable into a string. For instance, you might need to include a module's
version as part of a URI:

```yaml
      # ...
      env:
        OTHER_MODULE_ENDPOINT: http://other-module/api/${modules.other-module.version}
```

Note that while the syntax looks similar to template strings in Javascript, you can currently only do simple
lookups of keys. However, it is possible to do nested templating. For a somewhat contrived example:

```yaml
      # ...
      env:
        OTHER_MODULE_ENDPOINT: http://${variables.auth-module}/api/${modules.${variables.auth-module}.version}
```

There the name of the module is pulled from the project/environment configuration, and used to find the
appropriate key under the `modules` configuration context.

## Reference

### Project configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `project` key in `garden.yml` files:

```yaml
{{{projectContext}}}
```

### Module configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `module` key in `garden.yml` files:

```yaml
{{{moduleContext}}}
```
